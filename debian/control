Description: Tool designed for extracting metadata of public documents
 Metagoofil is an information gathering tool designed for extracting metadata of 
 public documents (pdf,doc,xls,ppt,docx,pptx,xlsx) belonging to a target 
 company.
 .
 Metagoofil will perform a search in Google to identify and download the 
 documents to local disk and then will extract the metadata with different 
 libraries like Hachoir, PdfMiner? and others. With the results it will generate 
 a report with usernames, software versions and servers or machine names that 
 will help Penetration testers in the information gathering phase.
